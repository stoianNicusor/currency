# This is a currency app
### You can:
     -See what is the value of the displayed coins
     -Convert in RON from the other coins

### I used function useEffect to get the API data, await for waiting to receive the data and async for run and props, useState for comuncation. Also I used ParticleJs for background and eslint for good practice, code.
